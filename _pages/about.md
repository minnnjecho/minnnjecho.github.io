I am Master's student at Korea University. My [research](https://minnnjecho.github.io/research/) addresses issues in health and public economics, focusing on how socio-environmental factors affect health and economic behaviors. Previously, I received my B.A. in Economics, and Statistics from Korea University in 2022.

If you'd like to contact me, my email is mjcho@korea.ac.kr. You can find a copy of my CV [here](https://minnnjecho.github.io/files/CV_Minje_Cho.pdf).
