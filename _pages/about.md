I am Master's student at Korea University. My [research](https://naomishimberg.github.io/research/) addresses issues in environmental, energy, and labor economics, focusing on the structural changes to the U.S. economy necessary for the transition to clean energy. Previously, I received my B.A. in Economics, and Statistics from Korea University in 2022.

If you'd like to contact me, my email is mjcho@korea.ac.kr. You can find a copy of my CV [here](https://minnnjecho.github.io/files/CV_Minje_Cho.pdf).
