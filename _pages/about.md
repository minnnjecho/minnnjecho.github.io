Welcome!

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Economics at Pennsylvania State University. My [research](https://minnnjecho.github.io/research/) addresses issues in health and public economics, focusing on how socio-environmental factors affect health and economic behaviors. Previously, I earned my B.A. in Economics and Statistics and my M.A. in Economics from Korea University.

If you'd like to contact me, my email is mjcho@korea.ac.kr. You can find my CV [here](https://minnnjecho.github.io/files/CV_Minje_Cho.pdf).
